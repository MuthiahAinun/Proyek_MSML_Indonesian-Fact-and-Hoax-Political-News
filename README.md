# Proyek_MSML_Indonesian-Fact-and-Hoax-Political-News

## 🗂️ Dataset Description: **Indonesian Fact and Hoax Political News**

This dataset is a collection of Indonesian political news articles categorized into two main classes: Non-Hoax/Fact (valid) and Hoax (disinformation). It is sourced from both credible and non-credible platforms and is intended for training text classification models to detect fake news.

**📁 Dataset Files**

The dataset consists of the following files and their respective sources:

- `dataset_tempo_6k_cleaned.xlsx` – Valid political news from Tempo (~6,000 entries)

- `dataset_kompas_4k_cleaned.xlsx` – Valid political news from Kompas (~4,000 entries)

- `dataset_cnn_10k_cleaned.xlsx` – Valid political news from CNN Indonesia (~10,000 entries)

- `dataset_turnbackhoax_10_cleaned.xlsx` – Hoax news from Turnbackhoax.id (~10,000 entries)

**✅ Truth Labels**

1. **Valid / Factual:** Collected from mainstream and trusted news portals: CNN Indonesia, Tempo, and Kompas.

2. **Hoax / Disinformation:** Collected from Turnbackhoax.id, a site that aggregates and verifies false or misleading claims.

**🔍 Dataset Source**

This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle:  
[Indonesian Fact and Hoax Political News](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linkgish/indonesian-fact-and-hoax-political-news?resource=download)

## ⚙️ Project Workflow Overview (GitHub Actions)

This project is designed to be built and executed using **GitHub Actions workflows**. 

### Step 1️⃣ : Running the Preprocessing Pipeline Workflow (`preprocess.yml`)
The first step in the process is **preprocessing the four datasets**. Simply trigger the workflow defined in the `preprocess.yml` file located in `.github/workflows/`.

Once the workflow runs successfully, the **preprocessed dataset will be saved as an artifact**, which can be downloaded directly from the GitHub Actions interface.

> This setup ensures reproducibility and automation of the preprocessing phase, making it easier to integrate into continuous workflows and model training pipelines.

### Step 2️⃣ : Running the CI Workflow (`ci.yaml`)

The second step of this project involves running the **CI workflow file `ci.yaml`**, which automates the training and evaluation process. This workflow will trigger the execution of `train_and_log.py` and `modelling.py`. The key processes in this step include:

- Performing **oversampling using Easy Data Augmentation (EDA)** to address class imbalance (minority class: `hoax == 1`)
- Tokenizing the text data
- Setting up PyTorch DataLoaders
- Splitting the dataset into 80% training and 20% validation
- Loading a **pre-trained model** from Hugging Face:  
  🔗 [Hugging Face Model - distilbert-hoax-classifier](https://huggingface.co/Muthiah192/distilbert-hoax-classifier/tree/main)
- Evaluating the model on the dataset
- Uploading MLflow artifacts
- Building and pushing a Docker image to Docker Hub:  
  🔗 [Docker Image - Hoax Exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/muthiah192/hoax-exporter)

## Step 3️⃣: Building a Monitoring Dashboard Using Prometheus and Grafana (Locally)

In this step, we set up **monitoring and alerting** using **Prometheus and Grafana** on a local machine. This monitoring system helps us track the performance and behavior of the deployed model in real-time.

---

### 🐳 Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Docker Desktop**
   - Download and install Docker Desktop for your OS from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. **Run Docker Compose**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - This command will start four services:
     - **Exporter**: Serves model metrics using the Docker image from the previous step.
     - **Inference**: Runs inference using all files in the `inference_service` folder.
     - **Prometheus**: Collects metrics defined in `prometheus_exporter.py`.
     - **Grafana**: Provides a UI for monitoring and setting alerts.

---

### 🔧 `docker-compose.yml` Explanation

```
exporter:
  image: muthiah192/hoax-exporter:latest
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  restart: always
```
**Exporter:** Runs the Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint from the prebuilt Docker image. It exposes metrics like accuracy, precision, and system resource usage on port 8000.

---
```
inference:
  build:
    context: "C:/Users/ACER NITRO V15/inference_service"
  ports:
    - "8001:8001"
  restart: always
```
**Inference:** Builds a Docker image from local files in the inference_service directory and serves inference results on port 8001.

---
```
prometheus:
  image: prom/prometheus:latest
  volumes:
    - "/c/Users/ACER NITRO V15/Monitoring/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
  ports:
    - "9090:9090"
  restart: always
```
**Prometheus:** Collects metrics by scraping from the exporter. It reads its configuration from the prometheus.yml file and serves its dashboard on port 9090.

---
```
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:latest
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  restart: always
  volumes:
    - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana
  environment:
    - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    - GF_SMTP_ENABLED=true
    - GF_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com:587
    - GF_SMTP_USER=amirahannazihah@gmail.com
    - GF_SMTP_PASSWORD=APP_PASSWORD
    - GF_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=amirahannazihah@gmail.com
    - GF_SMTP_SKIP_VERIFY=true
```
**Grafana:** Visualizes data from Prometheus and sends alert notifications to email when thresholds are breached.

---
## 📈 Monitored Metrics

The following Prometheus metrics are defined in prometheus_exporter.py:
```
precision_non_hoax = Gauge('precision_non_hoax', 'Precision for non-hoax class')
recall_non_hoax = Gauge('recall_non_hoax', 'Recall for non-hoax class')
f1_non_hoax = Gauge('f1_non_hoax', 'F1-score for non-hoax class')

precision_hoax = Gauge('precision_hoax', 'Precision for hoax class')
recall_hoax = Gauge('recall_hoax', 'Recall for hoax class')
f1_hoax = Gauge('f1_hoax', 'F1-score for hoax class')

accuracy = Gauge('accuracy', 'Overall accuracy')
cpu_usage = Gauge('cpu_usage', 'CPU usage (%)')
memory_usage = Gauge('memory_usage', 'Memory usage (%)')

pred_non_hoax = Gauge('predicted_non_hoax', 'Total predicted non-hoax')
pred_hoax = Gauge('predicted_hoax', 'Total predicted hoax')

last_updated = Gauge('last_updated_timestamp', 'Timestamp of last metrics update')
```
---
## 📊 Grafana Dashboard & Alerts

Grafana dashboards are created using data sourced from Prometheus.

**Sample dashboard:**
![Dashboard Screenshot](Model/Dashboard-Monitoring-Grafana-12-metrics.png)

**Alerting Example:**

An alert rule is triggered if accuracy drops below 90%, and Grafana sends a notification to the configured email.

![Alert Rule Example](Monitoring/Alerting%20Grafana/Rule_Accuracy.png)

## 🧪 Inference Testing

You can perform inference directly from the running Docker container.

Example hoax inference result:
