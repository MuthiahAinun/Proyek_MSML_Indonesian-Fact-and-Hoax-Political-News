# Dicoding Submission Folder Structure

This folder is specifically created to comply with the folder structure required by Dicoding's submission format, **without adding or removing any files related to the original project**.

All directories and files have been carefully adjusted to align with the requirements of each evaluation criterion while **preserving the integrity of the original project**.

> Please note: Modifying the original project structure would affect the entire workflow and processes that have already been implemented.  
Therefore, to ensure a smoother and clearer assessment process by the Dicoding reviewers, I have adapted both the **folder structure and its contents** based on the original project.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.
