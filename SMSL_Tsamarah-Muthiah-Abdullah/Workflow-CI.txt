This project involves running the CI workflow file ci.yaml, which automates the training and evaluation process. This workflow will trigger the execution of train_and_log.py and modelling.py. The key processes in this step include:

1. Performing oversampling using Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) to address class imbalance (minority class: hoax == 1)
2. Tokenizing the text data
3. Setting up PyTorch DataLoaders
4. Splitting the dataset into 80% training and 20% validation
5. Loading a pre-trained model from Hugging Face:
ðŸ”— Hugging Face Model - distilbert-hoax-classifier : https://huggingface.co/Muthiah192/distilbert-hoax-classifier/tree/main
6. Evaluating the model on the dataset
7. Uploading MLflow artifacts
8. Building and pushing a Docker image to Docker Hub:
